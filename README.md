## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The p-value of our linear regression is 5.21e-08 which is much smaller than the assumed significance level of .05%. 
Therefore, the slope of the linear module is not zero.

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The R-squared value is .715, which means that 71% of the regression model predicts accurately.
