## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

* The p-value of our linear regression is 5.21e-08 which is much smaller than the assumed significance level of .05%. 
Therefore, the slope of the linear module is not zero.

* The R-squared value is .715, which means that 71% of the regression model predicts accurately.  


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
* In the total_summary dataframe, the variance of the suspension coil's PSI is 62.3 which falls within the range of the 
MechaCar's >100 pounds per suare inch specifications. However, when examining the lot_summary dataframe, both lot1 and 
lot2 have variances of much less than 100 pounds, while lot3 has a variance of 170 which exceeeds the MechaCar's design 
specs. Therefore the current manufacturing data meets the design specification for only Lots1 and Lots2, but not Lot3.
